An operation is a service object.

Its goal is simple: Remove all business logic from the controller and model and provide a separate, streamlined object for it.

Operations implement functions of your application, like creating a comment, following a user or exporting a PDF document. Sometimes this is also called command.

Technically, an operation embraces and orchestrates all business logic between the controller dispatch and the persistence layer. This ranges from tasks as finding 

or creating a model, validating incoming data using a form object to persisting application state using model(s) and dispatching post-processing callbacks or even
 nested operations.
