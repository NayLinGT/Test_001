What is webpack?
The goal of webpack, or any front-end build system,
is to allow you to write your front-end code in a 
way that is convenient for developers and then package
that code in a way that is convenient for browsers. 
With webpack, you can manage JavaScript, CSS, and 
static assets like images or fonts. Webpack will allow 
you to write your code, reference other code in your
application, transform your code, and combine your code
into easily downloadable packs.
